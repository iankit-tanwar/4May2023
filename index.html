            <p>The Manipur government has issued a 'shoot at sight' order in extreme cases in the violence-hit state if all
                forms of persuasion, warnings are exhausted. As the state is seeing violent protests over the Tribal Solidarity
                March organised by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur protesting the ST status demand of non-tribal Meiteis,
                the government authorised the DMs and SDMs to issue shoot-at-sight orders. "In view of the prevailing law and
                order situation following the unwanted incidents that occurred at the Tribal Solidarity March 2023 held on May
                3, 2023, and in order to maintain public order and tranquillity in the State, the Governor of Manipur has
                authorized all District Magistrates, Sub- Divisional Magistrates and all Executive Magistrates/ Special
                Executive Magistrates detailed by the District Magistrates concerned to issue Shoot at sight orders in extreme
                cases whereby all forms of persuasion, warning, reasonable force, etc. had been exhausted under the provisions
                of law under CrPC, 1973 and the situation could not be controlled," the order said. Read | Triggers of Manipur

                account for 40% of the state's population. They are opposing the ST status of the Meitei community. The Manipur
                high court recently asked the state government to send a recommendation to the Centre on the demand of the Metei
                community.</P>

            <p>Attacks and retaliatory attacks are going on in several districts of the state leading to arson, vandalism.
                About 5,000 people have been shifted from the violence-hit areas.</p>

            <img src="./3.avif" alt="">
            <p>Rohit Sharma added a third IPL title to his cabinet as captain - and fourth overall - as his Mumbai Indians side defeated Rising Pune Supergiant in a dramatic final in the 2017 edition. After putting only 129/8 on the board, the MI bowlers, led by Mitchell Johnson (3/26), produced an emphatic performance to hold Steve Smith's RPS a run short in the title clash. MI were dominant throughout the season, finishing at the top of the table with 20 points; however, it was a forgettable season for previous year's finalists Royal Challengers Bangalore, as they ended at the bottom with 10 losses. Sunrisers Hyderabad's David Warner was the Orange Cap holder with 641 runs to his name, while his teammate Bhuvneshwar Kumar - on the second-successive occasion - won the Purple Cap, this time with 26 wickets in 14 matches.</p>

            <img src="./4.avif" alt="">
            <p>Last month, Palak Tiwari made a comment that Salman Khan had a rule about how women should dress on the sets of Antim. Before she made her acting debut with Salman's Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan, Palak was an assistant to filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar for the film. Salman, in another interview, addressed her remarks and shared that women's bodies are more precious and should be covered. Since the comments about the dress code for women has blown up, Palak addressed them in a new interview in which she stressed that she didn't mean to imply anything inappropriate about Salman and his methods on set. (Also read: ‘Jitni dhaki huyi hongi, better hai’: Salman Khan on not allowing low neckline outfits on his set)

                Palak Tiwari made her film debut in Salman Khan's Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan.
                Palak Tiwari made her film debut in Salman Khan's Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan.
                Palak is the daughter of actor Shweta Tiwari and Salman Khan has also known her since she was a small child. Shweta was the winner of the television reality show Bigg Boss, hosted by Salman, in 2010. After Palak had made the comments and later clarified that she wanted to have certain guidelines on how to dress around senior artistes, Salman had also added that there was a problem in the way men looked at women and he didn't like that behaviour around him.</p>

            <P> In an interview with ETimes, Palak explained the misunderstanding, "[It's] part and parcel of what we do. Also, I'm not really taken aback by it, since I know Salman sir is an extremely understanding individual and he knows me. He knows that I would never say anything malapropos about him, ever. I take this as more of a learning experience. This is the best way to learn, making a mistake [since] I never want to be in that position again. I think it's the most conducive way to learn. I made a mistake, I'll learn and it's something I'll keep in mind for the rest of my life now."

                Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan released on the occasion of Eid on April 21. Palak also has the film The Virgin Tree which stars Sanjay Dutt lined up for release this year. The horror-comedy also stars Sunny Singh and Mouni Roy. Palak became known after her appearance in the music video of Harrdy Sandhu's Punjabi hit song Bijlee Bijlee.</p>

            <img src="./5.avif" alt="">
            <p>"We had nothing to do with this," said John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, on MSNBC.

                "Peskov is just lying there, pure and simple," he added.
                
                Russia alleges that Ukraine carried out a "terrorist attack" overnight Tuesday into Wednesday with two drones, aiming to kill President Vladimir Putin, a charge which Kyiv has denied.
                
                Peskov, Putin's longtime press secretary, said earlier Wednesday that "decisions on such attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington."
                
                "Kyiv only does what it is told to do," he added.
                
                The incident at the Kremlin comes amid several other recent explosions and trail derailments on Russian and occupied Ukrainian territory.
                
                Kirby reiterated in his interview to MSNBC on Wednesday that Washington does not support or condone attacks by Ukraine outside its borders.
                
                "We've been clear with them publicly and we've been clear with them privately that we do not encourage nor do we enable them to strike outside Ukraine," he said.</p>

            <img src="./6.avif" alt="">
            <p>In its application before the NCLT, Go First sought a declaration of bankruptcy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and create corporate insolvency resolution proceedings against itself.

                During the hearing, senior advocate P Nagesh representing the airline told the court that if they lose the aircraft, the airline’s business would come to a halt.
                
                The advocate also argued that the move to seize aircraft would affect around 7,000 employees working with the company. The plea also said that around 10,000 indirect employees will also be affected.
                
                During the hearing, the Tribunal observed that there are no provisions in IBC for an interim moratorium.
                
                After hearing the arguments, the court reserved its order.</p>

            <P> The cash-strapped airline Go First filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and as an interim measure sought a moratorium to prevent lessors from taking possession of planes.

                This was, however, opposed by the lessors representing 26 aircraft who challenged these proceedings contending that “this would jeopardise their contractual rights, adding that they want their aircraft back”.
